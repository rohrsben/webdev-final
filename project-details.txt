Project definition:
In this project, you will have to design an employee registration system to record basic information about a new employee in an organization. The system will also display the entries in summary and detailed formats.

For a new employee, the system should accept entries of:
    First name
    Middle name 
    Last name 
    Date of birth
    Social Security Number

    Address 1
    Address 2
    City
    State
    Zip

    Home phone Number
    Mobile phone Number
    Email Address

    Date of hire
    Current position
    Department
    Work phone Number
    

The system should validate entries to ensure the data is valid (SSN, DOB, Phone numbers, zip) using the techniques we have learned in this course

An object should be used to store each employee entry, and all employees should consist of an array of objects

The system should then store data in localStorage

Condition statements should be used to handle some aspects of form validation

The employee system should allow multiple employees to be displayed in a listing

Each employee listing should be clickable to allow details to be displayed on a new page, frame, or window in an easy to read format

The user should be able to return to enter a new employee. They should be able to view previously stored employees at any time

The employee listings should remain persistent as long as the browser remains open so the user can enter and view multiple employees in a session

A loop should be used to handle displaying data from the array in the general and detailed employee listing
